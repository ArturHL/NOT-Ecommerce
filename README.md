# NOT-Ecommerce
This repository contains NOT-Ecommerce which is a fake online store. It is created using PugJS, Less, Javascript with async and FETCH.


Some interesting features is that using asynchronism and the FETCH function, this project renders its products consuming the https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en/rest/introduction API.
This API is public, and has all CRUD methods enabled, so on the page you can create your user, upload/edit/delete products or categories.

Upcoming Updates:
- AUTH implementation with JWT
